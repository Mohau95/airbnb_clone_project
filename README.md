# Airbnb Clone Project
## Project Overview
The Airbnb Clone project is designed to replicate key functionalities of the Airbnb platform, including user management, property listings, booking system, reviews, and payments. The goal is to develop a scalable, secure, and user-friendly web application that demonstrates strong backend architecture and clean API design.

### Project Goals
- Build a full-stack web application using modern technologies.
- Implement core features like property management, booking, and secure payments.
- Ensure a robust and scalable backend with strong security practices.

### Tech Stack
- **Backend:** Django
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **API Layer:** GraphQL
- **Frontend (optional scope):** React or Vue.js
- **Containerization:** Docker
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions

## 1. Team Roles

### Backend Developer
Responsible for building the server-side logic, API endpoints, authentication, and database interactions.

### Database Administrator (DBA)
Manages database schema, optimizes queries, ensures data integrity, and handles migrations.

### Frontend Developer
Implements the user interface and integrates frontend components with backend APIs.

### DevOps Engineer
Sets up CI/CD pipelines, manages containerization (Docker), and oversees deployment environments.

### QA Engineer
Tests application functionality, performs bug tracking, and ensures product quality.

## 2. Technology Stack

- **Django:** A high-level Python web framework for rapid backend development and RESTful API implementation.
- **PostgreSQL:** A robust relational database for managing structured data like users, bookings, and payments.
- **GraphQL:** A query language for APIs enabling flexible and efficient data fetching.
- **Docker:** Used for containerizing the application to ensure consistency across development and production.
- **GitHub Actions:** For automating CI/CD pipelines, running tests, and deploying code.

## 3. Database Design

### Key Entities
1. **Users**
   - Fields: `id`, `name`, `email`, `password_hash`, `role`
   - Relations: A user can list multiple properties and make bookings.

2. **Properties**
   - Fields: `id`, `owner_id`, `title`, `description`, `price`
   - Relations: A property belongs to one user and can have many bookings.

3. **Bookings**
   - Fields: `id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `check_in`, `check_out`
   - Relations: A booking is linked to both a user and a property.

4. **Reviews**
   - Fields: `id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `rating`, `comment`
   - Relations: A user can write multiple reviews for different properties.

5. **Payments**
   - Fields: `id`, `booking_id`, `amount`, `status`, `payment_method`
   - Relations: A payment is associated with a single booking.

## 4. Feature Breakdown

- **User Management:** Handles user registration, authentication, and profile management. Ensures secure login and personalized experiences.
- **Property Management:** Allows hosts to list, edit, and manage properties with descriptions, images, and pricing.
- **Booking System:** Enables users to book properties, check availability, and manage reservations.
- **Review System:** Users can leave feedback and ratings on properties they have booked.
- **Payment Processing:** Securely handles transactions between guests and hosts using integrated payment gateways.

---

## 5. API Security

- **Authentication:** Uses secure token-based authentication (e.g., JWT) to verify user identities.
- **Authorization:** Ensures users can only access resources they own or are permitted to view.
- **Rate Limiting:** Protects the API from abuse by limiting the number of requests per user or IP.
- **Data Encryption:** Sensitive data such as passwords and payment details are encrypted.
- **Importance:** These measures protect user data, secure financial transactions, and maintain platform trust.

## 6. CI/CD Pipeline

CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) automates testing, building, and deploying the application to ensure faster and more reliable releases.

- **Continuous Integration (CI):** Automatically tests every commit and pull request.
- **Continuous Deployment (CD):** Automates deployment to staging or production environments.
- **Tools:** GitHub Actions for workflow automation, Docker for containerized deployments.
